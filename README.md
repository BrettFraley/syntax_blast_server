Syntax Blast - Server

Backend Elixir/Phoenix for my game Syntax Blast: https://github.com/BrettFraley/SyntaxBlast


- Stores built in and user submitted 'levels' in JSON
- Manages player accounts and game data
- Sets the stage for future live multiplayer features using Live View / Websockets

NOTE: Syntax Blast is a small amount of HTML, CSS, and JS and this server
is currently only for providing an API, administrative backend, and not yet for serving 
static files. Although, the step to convert what exists in Syntax Blast into Phoenix templates..
etc will be explored further.
